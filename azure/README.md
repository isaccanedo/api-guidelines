# Azure REST API Guidance
When building software components that will be used by developers to build other software, providing APIs that are easy to use, fit to purpose, scalable, maintainable, and consistent across your product can make the difference between success and failure for your software. 

Designing powerful APIs with strong defaults, consistent behavior across related projects, and ease of use for developers arises from putting yourself in the shoes of the person using your interfaces, and taking their concerns to heart. The APIs you ship can have a dramatic long term effect on the health of your software product, and that is why the **REST API Stewardship Board** is here to help! We have published a collection of best practices, REST guidance, and OpenAPI style guidelines to help you create an amazing developer experience.
